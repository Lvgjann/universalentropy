            <p class="general">
                Ravil Yefimov was destined to be a painter, but his parents preferred him to a career in the local
                police. Easily sensitive to stress, he compensates for this with advanced physical training.

                Ravil was not part of convoy 1138. He got hit by the bus trying to stop him without his car because he
                had lost the keys. It is also a miracle that he has survived since the beginning of the epidemic,
                because beyond being a bit clumsy, he is also very sensitive to stress.

                nurses, she is the only one to have survived or at least not to have fled Berezino following the riots.
                The long weeks managing a hospital almost only forged her mentally and made her a fighter.

                Nobody really knows where Vladimir comes from. He seems to be between 70 and 75 years old and has always
                refused to give any information about him. Vladimir still has an impassive face, though marked by the
                weather, but retains amazing physical strength for his age.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="general">
                Unlike the other survivors, Vladimir was not part of convoy 1138 and was already in hospital following a
                settlement with a certain Alexey. He currently has two broken ribs, but this does not affect his
                physical abilities.
