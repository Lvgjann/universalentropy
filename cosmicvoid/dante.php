        <p>
            A group of scientists on the Moon is trapped by an asteroid rain. Their only way to escape is blowing the
            spatial station to create a shockwave that will repulse them and a part of the Moon toward Mars. Few days
            later, the lead research team on Mars faces the collateral damages of the Moon. Both teams meet on Earth and
            decide to use the old Lutece’s technology to go back in time and reduce the population to avoid the
            catastrophe. They create a virus supposed to kill precised targets but it does not go as prepared and the
            virus turns people into zombies.</p>

        Quarantine and The End ? are the direct consequences of Last Chance : Virus 201 <br>
        At the end of The End ?, the United Government nukes the Earth. The survivors are few. New population coming
        from tears from Rapture’s sinking and Columbia’s fall are arriving. <br>
